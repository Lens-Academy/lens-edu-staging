title: Verification method explorer
summary_for_tutor: "An explorer for the ten verification methods in Wasil et al., Verification methods for international AI agreements. Each row carries the four boolean attributes of Figure 6 as pips (TR detects unauthorised training, DC detects unauthorised data center, CA requires country authorisation, HW requires hardware agreements; an asterisk on a pip marks the figure's nuanced cells) plus the research maturity of Figure 5 as a one, two or three bar chip. The learner cycles each attribute chip through any, only and not, toggles the three research-needed chips, sorts by figure order, research needed or name, and clicks a method to open a detail panel with the attribute readout, the figure caption's nuance note where the paper gives one, the Figure 5 reasoning, and the primary limitations and complementary methods quoted verbatim from Table 1. Chip-based reporting carries both Table 1 rows, fixed set reporting and firmware-based reporting. The widget completes once all ten methods have been opened. Two caveats the tutor should know: the Figure 6 caption says twelve methods but the figure itself lists ten, which matches the paper's own text, and Table 1's National intelligence services row has no Figure 6 or Figure 5 entry so it is not in the widget. The lesson page around the widget carries only a one-line lead-in; the Wasil national technical means excerpt sits above it and the works-cited callout below."
